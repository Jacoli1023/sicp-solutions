# SICP Exercise Solutions (WIP)

These are my exercise solutions for the well-regarded [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml), AKA the "wizard book". This is sort of a passion project of mine, as my first reading of this book changed the way I view and write programs; and now I wish to record and upload all the solutions to this book (or, or at the very least, the first three chapters).

I will be solving these exercises using [racket from the command line](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/racket.html), and the modules I'll be writing will be written in the Racket language.

This will be my biggest project so far, so I hope to learn a lot - not only from the wizard book, but also about general project management, deployment, and git tools. In the future, I may also upload some of my notes, which I've stored in markdown files on Obsidian.

Without any further ado, let's begin!
